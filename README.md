#watchout
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta). This project was worked on with a pair.

This is a game where the user controls a spaceshit and tries to avoid the asteroids.  We also implemented a particle systems that simulates the physics of collisions.
